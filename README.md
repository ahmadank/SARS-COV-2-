# Overview

This project was undertaken as part of an academic endeavor with two classmates. The objective of the project was to evaluate the level of risk that neighboring countries pose for the transmission of COVID-19. The European Union was chosen as the focus of this study due to the high number of shared borders between its member countries.

# My Role

I was responsible for the verification and cleaning of data, as well as the creation of data visualizations using Python NetworkX and Matplotlib. The team collectively analyzed the data and visualizations to formulate conclusions and hypotheses.

# Hypothesis

H0: The number of neighboring countries does not have an impact on the likelihood of earlier exposure to COVID-19.
H1: The number of neighboring countries has an impact on the likelihood of earlier exposure to COVID-19.

# Results

Upon analysis of the data, it was determined that the null hypothesis (H0) could not be rejected and the alternative hypothesis (H1) could not be accepted. Additionally, it was acknowledged that other factors such as air travel also played a significant role in the transmission of the virus. These findings provide valuable insights for further research in this field.
